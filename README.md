Simulated data from a virtual fish

Mostly working on simulatedData.m , Madgwick.m, and ComplementaryFilter.m

Madgwick.m implements a complementary filter with time-varying gamma and is better than ComplementaryFilter.m

ComplementaryFilter.m uses a constant gamma and uses accelerometer data when the acc. values are below a certain threshold.
